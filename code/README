Predictions
--------
Idea: 
There is an underlying abstract-base class for each method with shared computational 
parameters and per-task options. The fit method that returns a fitted CausalArray needs 
to be overriden in each inherited subclass. Additionally R scripts are easily callable 
for specific algorithms available in R packages.

Compute:
* Calling the fit method directly on an instance
* Embarassingly parallel by the included Pool class wihtin python
* Using GNU PARALLEL or SLURM via command line scripts

Groundtruths
--------
We distinguish internal groundtruths, that are computed from interventional data, and
external groundtruths, that are other datasets or domain sources

Internal groundtruths:
- Absolute value (abs)
- Absolute value normalized (abs.norm)
- Relative value (rel)
- Relative value normalized (rel.norm)
- IDA norm (ida, source: Maathuis 2009)
- Strong Intervention Effects (sie Meinshausen 2016)

External groundtruths
- MacIsaac data (MacIsaac 2006)
- Saccharomyces Genome Database (sgd) (Cherry 2012)
